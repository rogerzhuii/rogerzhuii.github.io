## About me

With a curious mind and an adventurous heart,  I am always seeking answers to various questions of different nature. Having worked part-time on a local farm, I saw how to plant a seed and wait for it to sprout and finally turn into fruits. As my farmer friend says, plant the seed first, and you will see the fruit, which sounds like a cause-effect to me. 

Being trained in graduate school offered me a chance to use data to detect the correlation or causation between things that are not always tangible. I plan to graduate in the early Spring of 2021 and would like to take any challenging jobs in research, teaching, and private industries. I will be available for interviews during the ASSA 2021 Virtual Annual Meeting.
